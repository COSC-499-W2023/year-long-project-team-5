## Non feature work
- Group meetings where we discussed the project

## All of my features for **this milestone**
 - Worked with team on project outline:
    - discussed and assigned myself features/types of work within the project I'd like to work on
    - defined the MVP with the team and helped clarify the project
    - helped the group on the milestones and some of the feature deadlines
    - helped settle on a "framework" for the project in consideration with the system arch. of our project option

## Status of work for the **last week**
- Project outline done

## Issue number reference
N/A since no coding this week.

## Other notes
I expect us to revise this plan as we go since I think we are planning to take an iterative approach to our project. It's too early to tell how well/fast we work as a team. 

Was still good to clarify what is expected of us in terms of the number of features we need to implement and by when.
