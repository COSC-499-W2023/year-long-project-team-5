## Non feature work
- Group meetings: discussed about setting up repo with AWS and amplify.
   - had the rest of the team review our wireframes and received good feedback on what to change
   - concerns with how we were previously setting up our front and backend; currently not best suited to work with Amplify
   - spent time researching about tech stacks, discussed whether we wanted to stick to Amplify, reviewed and revised current chosen tech stack: decided on using React as framework and GraphQL


## All of my features for **this milestone**

### Feature: build a library of React components 
- overview: have a library of key ui elements as components that can be reused and would act as key building blocks of the website.
- Spent time configuring amplify with the command line and learning how to use it to pull components 
- designed a few key components on Figma following best practices guidelines - I used [amplify UI kit library available on Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1047600760128127424/aws-amplify-ui-kit)  to build our own unique components to save time but also ensure that it will work with Amplify.

Status: good progress made with components, still need to make sure that Amplify can read our components correctly. Next stage would be learning React props and hooks as well as following video demos to make sure the components are responsive and functioning (ui wise; e.g text-field can be clicked on and take keyboard input)

## Status of work for the **last week**
We had to revise our chosen tech stack, look into system arch and configuration of our repo. A lot of the work I did using Figma to make initial components had to be revised so that it used the UI kit by AWS instead. 

## Other comments
I hope to be able test our front end with Selenium before the mini presentation but I have little experience; need to do research on how to design tests with Selenium. But also test-driven development seems hard for UI/UX. How to write tests before code for front end?

## Non feature work
- Group meetings where we discussed the agenda and allocated task


## All of my features for **this milestone**
 - Creation of a wireframe for our UI/UX interfaces. Admin page and user page were prioritized.
 - Abby and I researched on the best way to design wireframes. We wanted to have designs that could be implemented easily. 
    - We set up layout grids to align any visual elements in a way that could be recreated using CSS and bootstrap.
 - Abby and I worked on creating low and high fidelity wireframes

## Status of work for the **last week**
- Good progress on the wireframes, need to get feedback from teammates.
- Would like to create components on Figma to allow for simple and consistent wireframes.

## Issue number reference
 [Issue No. 8](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/word-chain-exercise-team-5/issues/8)
## Other notes
- We might be able to use Figma to translate the UI designs and components into CSS snippets which may or may not improve our workflow.

## Non feature work
- Group meetings where we discussed the project

## All of my features for **this milestone**
 - Worked with team on project outline:
    - discussed and assigned myself features/types of work within the project I'd like to work on
    - defined the MVP with the team and helped clarify the project
    - helped the group on the milestones and some of the feature deadlines
    - helped settle on a "framework" for the project in consideration with the system arch. of our project option

## Status of work for the **last week**
- Project outline done

## Issue number reference
N/A since no coding this week.

## Other notes
I expect us to revise this plan as we go since I think we are planning to take an iterative approach to our project. It's too early to tell how well/fast we work as a team. 

Was still good to clarify what is expected of us in terms of the number of features we need to implement and by when.
