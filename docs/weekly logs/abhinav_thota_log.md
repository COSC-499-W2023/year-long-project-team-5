![work done in week 5](https://i.imgur.com/WuzTgwc.png)

## Non feature work
- Group meetings where we discussed the agenda and allocated task


## All of my features for **this milestone**
 - Creation of a wireframe for our UI/UX interfaces. Admin page and user page were prioritized.
 - Abby and I researched on the best way to design wireframes. We wanted to have designs that could be implemented easily. 
    - We set up layout grids to align any visual elements in a way that could be recreated using CSS and bootstrap.
 - Abby and I worked on creating low and high fidelity wireframes

## Status of work for the **last week**
- Good progress on the wireframes, need to get feedback from teammates.
- Would like to create components on Figma to allow for simple and consistent wireframes.

## Issue number reference
 [Issue No. 8](https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/word-chain-exercise-team-5/issues/8)
## Other notes
- We might be able to use Figma to translate the UI designs and components into CSS snippets which may or may not improve our workflow.

## Non feature work
- Group meetings where we discussed the project

## All of my features for **this milestone**
 - Worked with team on project outline:
    - discussed and assigned myself features/types of work within the project I'd like to work on
    - defined the MVP with the team and helped clarify the project
    - helped the group on the milestones and some of the feature deadlines
    - helped settle on a "framework" for the project in consideration with the system arch. of our project option

## Status of work for the **last week**
- Project outline done

## Issue number reference
N/A since no coding this week.

## Other notes
I expect us to revise this plan as we go since I think we are planning to take an iterative approach to our project. It's too early to tell how well/fast we work as a team. 

Was still good to clarify what is expected of us in terms of the number of features we need to implement and by when.
