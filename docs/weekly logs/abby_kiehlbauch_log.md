- best practices for using AWS microservices and adjusting our system architecture 

## All of my features for **this milestone**

### **Feature**: Setting up system architecture

- **Issue number**: https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-5/issues/24

- **Issue number**: https://github.com/COSC-499-W2023/year-long-project-team-5/issues/32
- **Context**: We spent a significant amount of time researching and testing best practices when creating Figma components in order for them to be seamlessly into React components

## Status of work for the **last week**
