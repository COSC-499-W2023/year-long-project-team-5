## All of my features for **this milestone**

### **Feature**: Profile page
- **Description**: Finalize the profile page (remove unimplemented forms

- **Context**: After quite a bit of debugging I discovered the issue behind the profile page not accepting changes, however, the solution was going to be quite complex and the team decided it was no longer a priority.

### **Feature**: UI Improvements
- **Description**: Added tooltips to both the user and admin sign and added a download video option for the admin dashboard
- **Issue number**: issue #186 and #191
- **Context**: Tooltips were added to make the navigation of the site even easier, as a major feature for us is ease of access and ease of use.

- profile page reviewed and merged
